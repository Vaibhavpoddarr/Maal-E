## Important Launch files for using rusty or impelment rusty software on your custom bot 
  
  ### ROBOT STARTUP
  The Robot has to be connected to the motor driver. We are using L298N H-bridge motor driver, with 12v 500 RPM motors. The robot also uses RPLiDAR A1    connected the pi. Do refer [rplidar-ros](http://wiki.ros.org/rplidar).
  
 To run the LiDAR and motors
```bash
 roslaunch rusty_firmware motor_run.launch 
  
 ```
 - ### SLAM

  The following launch file will start HECTOR SLAM node
  ``` bash
roslaunch rusty rusty_slam.launch
```
 
NOTE:
  > Here rusty uses laser odometery, generated by undocumented part of hector slam. The hector slam package provides a parameter used to publish odometry of the robot 
  
## LOCALIZATION AND NAVIGATION using ROS packages
  
- #### Localization
  
Here we are using odometry by the laser scanner through hector slam. We are using AMCL or adaptive monte carlo localisation, for localisation. 

```bash
 roslaunch rusty robot_localize.launch
```

- #### Navigation
  
  The navigation stack using laser odometry, uses dijkastra's algorithm to create shortest path algorithm. 
  
  To run the navigation stack 
  
```bash
  roslaunch rusty navigation.launch 
```
  
NOTE: 
  > The Hector slam package can be used for implemnting in smaller areas and can use navigation for the same.
